# General Information

This is a basic VS Code sample project for the DSP course at H-KA in Karlsruhe, Germany.  
The source code in "system/" and "ldscripts/" is provided by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Christian Langen.  
This sample project is for Windows only. 
Find all documentation under "docs/". Most downloads should be available under "downloads/". All [download links](#download-links) are listed below.



# Prerequisites for this sample project

1. GCC
    - recommended release: 13.3 rel1
    - recommended location: "C:/GCC/arm-gnu-toolchain-13.3.rel1/" 
1. OpenOCD 
    - recommended location: "C:/OpenOCD/"
1. CMake
    - recommended location: "C:/CMake/"
1. Ninja
    - run "winget install Ninja-build.Ninja" in a Terminal
1. Install "CMSIS-DAP Driver.msi", see "downloads/FM4S6E2GMKitSetup_RevSB"
1. Check if board identifies as "FM-Link/CMSIS-DAP Cypress FM Communications Port" in Device Manager, if not see [Flash CMSIS-DAP FW on MB9AF312K](#flash-cmsis-dap-fw-on-mb9af312k)





# Usage of the project

- launch "hello_world.code-workspace"
- all required extensions should load automatically
- use "IF_DEBUG(debug_printf())" to send messages to the Serial Port Monitor
    - with "IF_DEBUG()", debug_printf() is automatically disabled in Release build
    - debug_printf() works exactly as printf()
- add each required source file to the "target_sources" commands in "CMakeLists.txt"
- Configure/Reconfigure and build the executable using the CMake extension
- select "GDB debugger CMSIS-DAP" in the "Run and Debug" extension before debugging
- start debugging with the "Run and Debug" extension.
- open the VS Code built-in Serial Port Monitor with the correct COM port to receive messages sent via debug_printf()

# How to use Semihosting

These instructions should not be needed, but are included for the sake of completeness.  
Refer to the file "downloads/FM4_FilterLab_1_3_Template/Eclipse_Application_Notes_Semihosting.pdf" for more information.
1. add following code in the file "hello_world/.vscode/launch.json" to the "GDB debugger CMSIS-DAP" configuration
    ```JSON
        "postLaunchCommands": [
            "monitor arm semihosting enable"
        ],
    ```
1. add following code before the main function
    ```C
    // needed for semihosting
    extern "C" void initialise_monitor_handles(void);
    ```
1. add following code before calling printf() for the first time
    ```C
    // needed for semihosting
    initialise_monitor_handles();
    ```
1. Modify the libraries included by the linker in "hello_world/ldscripts/s6e2cc_rom.ld"
    ```
    GROUP(libgcc.a libc.a librdimon.a libm.a libnosys.a)
    ```
1. use printf() to send messages via the debugger
