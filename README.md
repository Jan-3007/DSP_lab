# General Information

This is a basic VS Code sample project for the DSP course at H-KA in Karlsruhe, Germany.  
The source code in "system/" and "ldscripts/" is provided by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Christian Langen.  
This sample project is for __Windows__, but Linux is supported as well.  
Find all documentation under "docs/". Some downloads are available under "downloads/". All [download links](#download-links) are listed below.

## Linux

The following is specifically for the apt package manager (tested with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS).  
Required packages are: GCC, OpenOCD, CMake and Ninja.
Run the following commands:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openocd
sudo apt install cmake
sudo apt install ninja-build
sudo apt install libncursesw5
```

To install GCC:
- download from [website](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads)
    - section: "x86_64 Linux hosted cross toolchains"
    - subsection: "AArch32 bare-metal target (arm-none-eabi)"
    - file: "arm-gnu-toolchain-13.3.rel1-x86_64-arm-none-eabi.tar.xz"
- unzip and copy/move folder to "/opt/" using `cp -R arm-gnu-toolchain-13.3.rel1-x86_64-arm-none-eabi /opt/`
- if deviating, edit path in ".vscode/launch.json" and "toolchain_arm-none-eabi-gcc-13.3.Rel1.cmake"

Check for connected USB devices using `lsusb`.




# Usage of the project

- jumper configuration:
	- J1, J2 open
	- J4: 1-2
    - J3: 2-3 
- launch "hello_world.code-workspace"
- all required extensions should load automatically, install if prompted by VS Code
- use "IF_DEBUG(debug_printf())" to send messages to the Serial Port Monitor
    - with "IF_DEBUG()", debug_printf() is automatically disabled in Release build
    - debug_printf() works exactly as printf()
- add each required source file to the "target_sources" commands in "CMakeLists.txt"
- Configure/Reconfigure and build the executable using the __CMake__ extension
- select "GDB debugger CMSIS-DAP" in the "Run and Debug" extension before debugging
- start debugging with the "Run and Debug" extension.
- open the Serial Port Monitor with the correct COM port to receive messages sent via debug_printf()

# How to use Semihosting

These instructions should not be needed, but are included for the sake of completeness.  
Refer to the file "downloads/FM4_FilterLab_1_3_Template/Eclipse_Application_Notes_Semihosting.pdf" for more information.
1. add following code in the file "hello_world/.vscode/launch.json" to the "GDB debugger CMSIS-DAP" configuration
    ```JSON
        "postLaunchCommands": [
            "monitor arm semihosting enable"
        ],
    ```
1. add following code before the main function
    ```C
    // needed for semihosting
    extern "C" void initialise_monitor_handles(void);
    ```
1. add following code before calling printf() for the first time
    ```C
    // needed for semihosting
    initialise_monitor_handles();
    ```
1. Modify the libraries included by the linker in "hello_world/ldscripts/s6e2cc_rom.ld"
    ```
    GROUP(libgcc.a libc.a librdimon.a libm.a libnosys.a)
    ```
1. use printf() to send messages via the debugger
